When I was working on pacman and chess I was using regular sticky notes for tasks to do in project, but they aren't very comfortable for me to maintain ( especially when there is a lot of stuff written ). For several reasons programms that exists ( and I know ) doesn't suits me - so I decided to make my own which I will use.

It is on very early stage for now.
